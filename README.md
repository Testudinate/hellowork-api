# Hello Work API

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/italolelis/hellowork-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/italolelis/hellowork-api)

Have you ever ran into a problem of not finding or not knowing where one of our work colleagues were?
Sometimes they were on vacations or having a business travel and you didn't know when they would be back. 
Imagine if you can notify your colleagues that you are leaving for a business trip, or maybe you got sick
and can't go to the office, just by telling slack about it?

That's the whole idea behind HelloWork. Notify your colleagues when you are out of the office and if someone 
mention you they will know who is out of the office and for how long.

## Installation

You can choose to deploy this app with heroku. THis obviously the simplest way of doing it.
